# Transaction System

The Transaction system allows the user to insert a predefined CSV file containing transaction information (i.e. cost, type, date, etc). This will be read by the number of access layer classes and broken down into a number of stores that can be accessed by the user using one of the commands displayed. The program is accompanied by a testing file that uses mock objects to test the objects prior to writing the code, the tests are successful and provide a glimpse at the effectiveness of the program.
